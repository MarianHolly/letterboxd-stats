## 💡 Pro Tips

### During Implementation
1. Read one phase at a time
2. Test after each phase (don't wait until end)
3. Use print/logging to understand code
4. Keep browser console open for errors
5. Use curl to test API endpoints

### When Stuck
1. Re-read the architecture section
2. Look at test cases (they show expected behavior)
3. Check code comments
4. Use print statements to debug
5. Read error messages carefully

### For Best Learning
1. Do Option A first (learn patterns)
2. Do Option C second (see simplification)
3. Compare side-by-side
4. Understand trade-offs
